# Neoadjuvant Immuno-ChEmotherapy predictor based on Body Composition (NICE-BC)
## Clinical Demand
Existing tumor-intrinsic biomarkers incompletely predict pathological complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NICT) in patients with non‚Äìsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although body composition may influence immunometabolic status, whether three-dimensional CT‚Äìderived body composition metrics can serve as complementary and potentially feasible predictors of pCR remains unclear. To evaluate association of three-dimensional CT‚Äìderived body composition quantification with pCR in patients receiving NICT for NSCLC. Automated, three-dimensional CT‚Äìderived dynamic body composition quantification, particularly baseline skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes and their longitudinal changes during NICT, are independently associated with pCR in NSCLC. Incorporating these modifiable imaging-based body composition biomarkers into predictive models significantly improves performance beyond that achieved with clinical variables alone.

This repository is for the research study *"AI-Based 3D Body Composition Biomarkers Improve Pathologic Response Prediction in NSCLC Treated with Neoadjuvant Immunochemotherapy".* The research artcile is under submission for now.

### Key Features

We summarize the key contributions of this work in three-fold: 1) volumetric body composition segmentation, 2) body composition quantification, and 3) treatment response prediction model. 

‚úî **Volumetric body composition segmentation** 
- We used our previously developed deep learning model (AutoPanoM v1.0.0.0, MediaLab) to automatically locate vertebrae and pre-segment five body composition components, including vertebrae, skeletal muscle (SM), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and intermuscular fat tissue (IMAT). This model was developed using the nnUNet framework with three-dimensional (3D) full-resolution adaptive segmentation, trained on a cohort of more than 3000 CT cases.
  
‚úî **Body composition quantification**
- We quantified the volume of each tissue component from the first slice of first thoracic vertebra through the last slice of twelfth thoracic vertebra, as determined by the automated model. To adjust for individual body size, these volumes were indexed to height squared (cm¬≥/m¬≤), producing four volumetric metrics: skeletal muscle volume index (SMVI), intermuscular adipose volume index (IMVI), subcutaneous adipose volume index (SAVI), and visceral adipose volume index (VAVI).
  
‚úî **Treatment response prediction model**
- The AI-based prediction model incorporates Sex, Smoking status, Histological types, TPS, SMVI group, %‚àÜSMVI and %‚àÜSAVI.

For research reproducibility and clinical utility, we provided a software named Neoadjuvant Immuno-ChEmotherapy predictor based on Body Composition (NICE-BC), which integrates the above functionalities together.

# Usage

## Method 1: Source Code Installation

To run NICE-BC from source code, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhenweishi/LC-NICER
cd NICE-BC
conda create -n nice_bc python=3.12
conda activate nice_bc
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Method 2: Binary Release

For convenience, we provide pre-compiled binary packages for different operating systems. You can download the appropriate binary for your system from the [Releases](https://github.com/zhenweishi/LC-NICER/releases) page:

- **Windows**: Download `NICE-BC_windows_amd64.zip`
- **Linux**: Download `NICE-BC_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
- **macOS**: Download `NICE-BC_macos_arm64.dmg`

After downloading, simply run the executable file directly without any additional installation steps.

## Demo Data

üìÅ **Sample data for testing NICE-BC is available for download:**

You can access demo CT scan data from our Google Drive repository:
- **Demo Data**: [Download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12DTHqoDiSDCMGts-JZBuBqF69wbH21YC?usp=sharing)

The demo data includes sample DICOM files that you can use to test the body composition analysis functionality.

## Output Folders and Results Management

When you run NICE-BC, the software automatically creates two folders in the same directory as the executable:

### üìÇ Generated Folders:
- **`cache/`**: Stores temporary processing files and intermediate results
- **`results/`**: Contains the final analysis outputs, segmentation masks, and reports

### üìç Platform-specific Locations:

**Windows:**
```
# If executable file is C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\NICE-BC_windows_amd64\NICE-BC.exe
# Generated folders will be at:
C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\NICE-BC_windows_amd64\cache\
C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\NICE-BC_windows_amd64\results\
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# If executable file is /home/username/NICE-BC_linux_amd64/NICE-BC
# Generated folders will be at:
/home/username/NICE-BC_linux_amd64/cache/
/home/username/NICE-BC_linux_amd64/results/
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# If executable file is /Users/username/Applications/NICE-BC.app
# Generated folders will be at:
/Users/username/Applications/cache/
/Users/username/Applications/results/
```

### üìã Viewing Results:
- **Segmentation outputs**: Check the `results/` folder for DICOM files with segmented body composition masks
- **Analysis reports**: Look for CSV files and summary reports in the `results/` folder
- **Volume measurements**: Body composition metrics (SMVI, SAVI, VAVI, IMVI) will be saved as spreadsheet files

### üóëÔ∏è Cleaning Up Results:
To remove all generated files and start fresh:

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
rmdir /s cache
rmdir /s results
```

**Linux/macOS (Terminal):**
```bash
rm -rf cache/
rm -rf results/
```

Or simply delete the `cache` and `results` folders manually through your file manager.
