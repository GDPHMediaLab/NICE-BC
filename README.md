# Neoadjuvant Immuno-ChEmotherapy predictor based on Body Composition (NICE-BC)
## Clinical Demand
Existing tumor-intrinsic biomarkers incompletely predict pathological complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NICT) in patients with nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although body composition may influence immunometabolic status, whether three-dimensional CTâ€“derived body composition metrics can serve as complementary and potentially feasible predictors of pCR remains unclear. To evaluate association of three-dimensional CTâ€“derived body composition quantification with pCR in patients receiving NICT for NSCLC. Automated, three-dimensional CTâ€“derived dynamic body composition quantification, particularly baseline skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes and their longitudinal changes during NICT, are independently associated with pCR in NSCLC. Incorporating these modifiable imaging-based body composition biomarkers into predictive models significantly improves performance beyond that achieved with clinical variables alone.

This repository is for the research study *"AI-Based 3D Body Composition Biomarkers Improve Pathologic Response Prediction in NSCLC Treated with Neoadjuvant Immunochemotherapy".* The research artcile is under submission for now.

### Key Features

We summarize the key contributions of this work in three-fold: 1) volumetric body composition segmentation, 2) body composition quantification, and 3) treatment response prediction model.
